# Centaur Workflow
*A sustainable, AI-assisted system for deep, structured thinking.*

---

## 🌟 What This Project Is

The **Centaur Workflow** is your master template for all future projects that blend:

- Deep human reasoning
- AI-assisted exploration
- Structured reflection
- Reproducible data & notebook workflows
- Cloud sync + GitHub version control
- Automation tools that keep everything organized

Think of it as a **thinking environment** —
where your human strengths and AI strengths combine, centaur-style.

## 🧠 Workflow Philosophy

The Centaur Workflow follows three principles:

### **1. Externalize complexity**
Everything has a place. No clutter.  
Your mind stays free for thinking, not searching.

### **2. Make reflection a first-class citizen**
You don’t just do work — you document decisions, insights, dead ends, and next actions.

### **3. Automate the boring parts**
Syncing, pushing, verifying — handled by tools, not you.
